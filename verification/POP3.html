24-hour and 48-hour forecasts of probability of precipitation were made
by the Finnish
Meteorological Institute (FMI) during 2003, for daily precipitation in
the city of Tampere in south central Finland.
Three precipitation categories were used:<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category 0:&nbsp;&nbsp; RR &#8804; 0.2 mm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category 1:&nbsp;&nbsp; 0.3 mm &#8804; RR &#8804; 4.4 mm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Category 2:&nbsp;&nbsp; RR &#8805; 4.5 mm<br>
The probability of rain in each category was predicted each day, with
the probabilities across the three categories adding up to 1. Click <a
 href="POP_3cat_2003.txt">here</a> to view the data.<br>
<br>
It is possible to verify these probabilistic forecasts using a variety
of verification plots
and statistics. Recall that verification of
probability
forecasts requires many samples in order to assess forecast quality,
as it is not possible to say whether a single probability forecast
(say, 30%) is right or wrong for a single outcome. The Tampere dataset
gives forecasts for 365 days (actually a bit fewer since some days were
missing), which is quite adequate for verifying probability forecasts.<br>
<br>
First consider the probability of precipitation (POP), where "no
precipitation" corresponds to Category 0, and "precipitation"
corresponds to Categories 1 and 2 put together. This effectively treats
the multi-category forecast like a forecast for a binary event. We can
also consider the probablity of precipitation in the highest
category (POP<sub>hi</sub>) by taking "not heavier precipitation" to
correspond
to Categories 0 and
1, and "heavier precipitation" to correspond to Category 2.<br>
<br>
The <a href="../verif_web_page.html#BS">Brier score</a> measures
the
mean squared probability error. It can be decomposed into three terms,
where the first term measures the reliability (this term should be
small for
good forecasts), the second term measures the resolution (this term
should be large for good forecasts, and is subtracted), and the third
term measures the
climatological uncertainty (independent of the forecast
quality). For the Tampere forecasts the values of these quantities
were:<br>

The Brier score had lower values for the 24-hour forecasts than for the
48-hour forecasts, which means that the 24-hour forecasts were more
accurate. The difference was due mainly to the 24-hour forecasts having
better resolution (i.e., they were better at separating "precipitation
"
from "no precipitation"). The differences in the uncertainties between
the 24- and 48-hour forecasts relate to different days having missing
data - for a complete dataset these values would be identical.&nbsp;
The POP<sub>hi</sub> forecasts were more accurate than
the POP forecasts. This is partly because heavier rainfall was
rarer and the Brier score is heavily influenced by the no-event cases.
To
account for the relative frequency or rarity of events, the skill of
the forecast relative to the
sample climatology is often reported. The values of <a
 href="../verif_web_page.html#BSS">Brier
skill score</a> shown in the bottom row of the table show that the
24-hour forecasts for heavier rainfall occurrence were more skillful
than for lighter rainfall or the longer forecast period.<br>

 hspace="5" width="313">The
reliability of the forecasts, that is, the degree to which the forecast
probabilities match the observed frequencies, can be assessed using a <a
 href="../verif_web_page.html#reliability">reliability diagram</a>.
The
reliability of the 24-hour POP forecasts is shown by the heavy line in
the diagram at left. If the forecasts had perfect reliability (i.e., no
bias) this
curve would lie along the diagonal 1:1 line. The dashed horizontal line
shows the climatological frequency, and the dotted line midway between
the 1:1 line and the horizontal denotes no skill relative to
climatology. The location of the
reliability curve to the right of the diagonal indicates that the
probabilities were overestimated for all but the zero-probability
cases, and only for the higher probability categories did the POP
forecasts have more skill than climatology. The bar chart in the upper
left of the plot shows the number of
times each probability value was predicted. <span

 src="reliability24_hi.gif" style="width: 313px; height: 282px;"
 align="right" hspace="5">The reliability diagram for the 24-hour POP<sub>hi</sub>
forecasts (right) shows a reliability curve much closer to the diagonal
at low probabilities, but veering sharply away for probabilities of 0.5
or greater. However, these higher probabilities were rarely forecast
(only eight forecasts of POP<sub>hi</sub> equal to 0.5 or more) so
the reliability curve is noisy because of undersampling. (In practice
it is a good idea
to plot data only when there are enough samples.)<br>
<br>
The <a href="../verif_web_page.html#ROC">Relative Operating
Characteristic (ROC)</a> is often used to measure how well the
probabilistic forecasts discriminate between events and non-events
(resolution). Because it is independent of bias it can be viewed as a
kind of <span style="font-style: italic;">potential </span>skill. The
ROC curve for 24-hour POP forecasts is shown here.<img alt="ROC curve"
 src="ROC_POP24.gif" style="width: 313px; height: 274px;" align="left"
 hspace="5">
A forecast that discriminates perfectly would have a ROC curve that
starts in the lower left and follows the y-axis (false alarm rate=0)
up to the top left corner, then follows the top axis (hit rate=1) to
the upper right corner. The area under the ROC curve is a scalar
measure that is frequently used to summarize the resolution. The
perfect
value is 1.0 and the no-skill value is 0.5. For the Tampere forecasts
the following ROC areas are obtained using both a simple trapezoid
method and a curve-fitting method (preferred) to
estimate the area under the curve:<br>

These ROC areas suggest that the forecasts were able to
resolve lighter and heavier rainfall with about the same ability. This
similarity in the potential skill was not readily
obvious from the Brier score, partly due to the bias in the POP
forecasts.<br>
<br>
Another diagnostic that is related to forecast resolution, but puts the
performance into a decision-making context, is the <a
 href="../verif_web_page.html#relative%20value">relative value</a>.
This measures the usefulness of a forecast in minimizing the economic
costs associated with protecting against the effects of bad weather and
the losses incurred when bad weather occurs but the user did not take
protective action. The improvement in economic value of the forecast is
measured
relative to that of a climatology forecast and usually plotted as a
function of the cost/loss ratio. For probabilistic forecasts the curve
of interest is actually an envelope of&nbsp; curves representing each
of the probability values allowed by the forecast (in this case, 0.0,
0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0),<img alt="relative value curve" src="value24.gif"
 align="right" height="274" hspace="5" width="313">
and this envelope may look quite lumpy. The relative value curve shown
here for
the 24-hour POP forecasts is a case in point. The lighter
curves represent the relative value as a function of cost/loss ratio
using each of the probabilities as a yes/no threshold for the forecast,
while the heavy curve is the outer envelope representing the maximum
relative value possible. The maximum relative value of 0.57 occurred
for a moderate cost/loss ratio of 0.23, which is the climatological
frequency of rain in the sample. This plot shows that the POP forecasts
have value for all decision makers except those with very low cost/loss
ratios (who would always protect) or very high cost/loss ratios (who
would never protect). <br>
<br>
All of the plots and statistics shown so far have only considered the
two-category cases of rain/no rain or heavier rain/not heavier rain. A
summary score that takes multiple categories into account is the <a
 href="../verif_web_page.html#RPS">ranked probability score</a>
(RPS), which measures the
closeness of the probability forecasts in all categories to the
category
in which the observation fell. For example, if the observation was in
category 2, then a probability forecast for categories 0, 1, and 2 of
[0.3, 0.6, 0.1] would score better than a forecast of [0.7, 0.2, 0.1]
because the "weight" of the forecast was closer to the correct
category. To put the ranked probability scores into context, the <a
 href="../verif_web_page.html#RPSS">ranked probability skill score</a>
(RPSS) with respect to climatology is often used. For the year's worth
of probability forecasts for Tampere the mean values of RPS, and the
skill scores computed from these values, were:<br>
