ABSTRACT</h3>
Commonly used verification methods for weather elements and numerical weather
prediction model forecasts are described in terms of a general verification
model. The advantages and disadvantages of each verification method are
identified and discussed. Furthermore, numerous examples using meteorological
data are provided. New ideas in verification are included in a separate
chapter.
