mean, and how do some scores encourage hedging?</font></font></b>

<p>The Oxford English dictionary defines "to hedge" as, "To avoid a definite
decision or commitment" or "to reduce one’s risk of loss on a bet or speculation
by compensating transactions on the other side". In more general terms,
to "hedge one’s bets" is "to protect oneself against loss or error by supporting
more than one side in a contest, an argument etc". In the context of forecasting
, hedging would mean the avoidance of a definite (specific or categorical)
forecast, opting instead for a probabilistic forecast. The forecaster,
instead of "putting all his eggs in one basket" and forecasting a single
outcome with 100% probability, hedges his bets by assigning non-zero probability
to more than one possible outcome.
<p>In terms of forecast verification, probability forecasts which avoid
the extremes of the probability range often receive more favorable scores,
especially with quadratic scoring rules such as the root mean square error
or Brier Score. This is because an extreme forecast is heavily penalized
if it is incorrect. Thus a forecaster can minimize his risk of obtaining
an unfavorable score on a particular forecast by hedging. At the same time,
he lowers the maximum positive score he can obtain if he is correct.
<p>In terms of forecast attributes as defined by Murphy (1993), hedged
forecasts lack sharpness; they are smooth; probabilities are assigned over
a broader range of possible outcomes. In the context of spatial forecasts,
hedging means a tendency to underforecast the intensity of systems or to
forecast the location of sharply defined features such as fronts with less
precision.
<p>"Hedging" has been given a somewhat different, but consistent interpretation
by Murphy and Epstein (1967) and Murphy (1978). These authors considered
only probabilistic forecasts, and defined hedging by the statement, "Hedging
is said to occur whenever a forecaster’s judgment and forecast differ".
For example, if the forecaster truly believes the probability of an event
is 50%, but issues a forecast probability of 20%, motivated, for example,
by a desire to improve his verification score, then he is said to have
hedged his forecast.
<p>Apparent inconsistencies between this definition and the above arise
because of differences in restrictions placed on forecasts vis-&agrave;-vis
hedging. A categorical forecast may be required of a forecaster (he must
make a decision), and he is not given the opportunity to use probabilities
other than the categorical values of 0 and 100%. In such cases, given the
known uncertainty of future weather, a categorical forecast can be almost
always viewed as a hedged forecast in the sense that it does not correspond
with the forecaster’s true belief about the likelihood of the chosen outcome.
At the same time, hedging by avoiding forecasts of extreme probabilities,
when this option is available, has been demonstrated many times to generally
improve verification scores, as stated above. However, this arises because
the forecaster is then allowed to forecast according to his true belief,
not because he has been able to "play the score".
<p>Some verification scores may actually encourage forecasters to "play
the score". Three screening criteria can be used to judge whether performance
measures encourage hedging (Murphy, 1996):
<blockquote><i>Equitability</i> - A score is "equitable" if it gives the
same score for two types of unskilled forecasts: random chance, and constant
forecasts of the same category. In other words, forecasts of random chance,
"always yes", "always no", "always category 3", etc. should produce the
same (bad) score.
<p><i>Consistency</i> - In terms of performance measures, a score is "consistent"
when it is the appropriate score for judging the quality of a deterministic
or single-category forecast. If in reality the forecaster's judgement is
represented by a probability distribution, but he/she must issue a single
forecast according to some decision rule (for example, "forecast the mean
of the distribution", or "forecast yes when the probability exceeds a certain
threshold"), a consistent score gives an optimum value when the decision
rule is followed (Mason, 1979, 2003). In the case of binary (yes/no) forecasts,
the probability threshold that gives a consistent score depends on the
score being used.
<p><i>Propriety</i> - A score is "proper" when the score is optimized (has
a maximum or minimum value, whichever is appropriate) if the forecast corresponds
to the best judgement of the forecaster. Propriety is a special case of
consistency, and applies only to probability forecasts. If there is only
one unique maxima, then the score is "strictly proper" (For further mathematical
development on strictly proper scoring, see Murphy and Epstein (1967),
Wilks (1995, p.267), or <a href="http://www.nssl.noaa.gov/users/brooks/public_html/feda/note/properscoring.html">Harold
Brooks' lecture notes</a>.)</blockquote>
Several binary verification scores are listed below, along with their equitability
and optimal threshold probability (Mason, 1979, 2003). In the expressions
for optimal threshold probability, s refers to the base rate (also known
as the sample climatology, or marginal probability of the observed event,
equal to (<i>hits</i> + <i>misses</i>) / <i>N</i>), and
<i>N</i> is the
total number of forecasts made. In some cases the optimal decision threshold
depends on the value of the score itself, which would make it difficult
to specify a decision threshold in advance.
