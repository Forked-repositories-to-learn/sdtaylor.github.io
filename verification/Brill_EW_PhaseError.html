<h1>
1. Introduction.</h1>
In the past, assessing forecast phase errors was a laborious process requiring
manual tracking of systems. The emphasis was usually on position errors
for high and low pressure centers. Because of the time and effort required,
results were few in number and of questionable statistical significance.
This automated system uses a different approach to the phase error assessment
problem. It considers both high and low pressure centers, troughs, and
ridges and takes into account the typical synoptic scale wavelength. While
it would not necessarily yield the identical result as the manual method
in any given particular case, it can be applied to every forecast over
some period of time. With the large number of cases, mean positive and
negative phase shift errors have statistical significance and give some
indication of typical phase errors over a particular region.
<p>This introduction continues with a brief description of forecast verification
in very general terms. Following in Section 2 is a brief description of
the automated phase error calculation procedure. Section 3 briefly describes
a specific application of the procedure.
<p>In general, any forecast verification procedure may be thought of as
some operator V acting on a forecast f and its verifying observed values
o yielding one or more values to be operated upon by some normalizing or
score generating function E to give the final value or vector of values
s:
<center>s = E ( V(f,o) )</center>

<p><br>
<br>
<p>For example, in the case of bias, V(f,o)=f-o, and E is the averaging
operator (summation, followed by dividing by the number summed). Although
s is presented here as the composition of two functions, E and V. It is
often the case that both E and V are themselves composite functions, the
division of mathematical labor between E and V may sometimes be chosen
arbitrarily for the convenience of the problem under consideration and
the method of data storage and processing. In general, the first function
of which V is composed must be some transformation applied in the same
way to both the verifying observations and the forecast values and a comparison
operator of some sort. This may be expressed as T(f)~T(o), where T represents
the transformation and ~ represents the operator. In the example of bias,
T is the identity transformation and ~ is the subtraction operator.
<p>This general description of the verification process is presented in
this way to show that considerable creativity may be expressed in the design
of these procedures. As long as the same thing is done to both the forecast
and observed or analyzed values, it is possible to compute a measure of
forecast verification that has validity. The usefulness of the measure
to forecasters depends upon how well it can be related to factors that
are considered during the forecasting process itself.
<h1>
2. The Phase Error Calculation.</h1>
The phase error calculation starts with the application of the transformation,
T, to both the gridded forecast and gridded verifying analysis fields.
T, in this case, is a multi-step operation:
<ol>
<li>
Interpolate gridded fields to latitude/longitude points in a bounded zonal
band or strip.</li>

<li>
Average meridionally in each zonal strip to produce a single array of values
as a function of latitude only for both the forecast and the analysis.</li>

<li>
Perform cosine series trigonometric approximations to both the forecast
and analysis arrays of values.</li>

<li>
Compute the variance associated with each spectral component of the trigonometric
approximation for both the forecast and analysis.</li>

<li>
Sort the variance values in descending order for both forecast and analysis.
Also order the wave numbers of these spectral components in accordance
with this sorting.</li>

<li>
Compare results of the preceding sort to make sure that the hierarchy of
wave numbers is the same for the forecast and analysis for all wave numbers
for which a phase error is requested. If the hierarchies differ, the forecast
and analysis fields are too dissimilar to permit a phase error calculation.</li>

<li>
Compute the phase angle associated with the cosine series representation
of the trigonometric approximations for both the forecast and the analysis.
Do this for each spectral component being compared (usually just one, the
spectral component bearing most of the variance).</li>
</ol>
Transformation, T, as described above, yields one or more phase angle values,
for both the forecast and the analysis. What is done to the forecast has
been done in identical fashion to the analysis. Now, the operator (~) must
be applied. In this case, it is simply a subtraction followed by a check
to make sure that the phase angle difference (error) lies between -PI and
+PI. The function V uses the wavelength of the spectral component and the
average latitude of the zonal band to convert the phase angle error into
a distance displacement in kilometers. Finally, the function E is the identity
operator. Of course, E could be a time averaging operator applied to the
same zonal band and spectral component, or it could be multiplication by
a weighting function based on the magnitude of the variance associated
with the spectral component.
<p>The phase errors represent east/west displacements of the forecast relative
to the analysis within zonal bands. Actual phase errors often have north/south
components, and would, therefore, be larger in magnitude than represented
by this approach. Future development will extend this method to two dimensions
to determine a field of vector phase errors. In the future approach, the
gradient of the forecast difference field will provide the basis for determining
the direction of the phase error vector; while, its magnitude will be determined
using the method outlined above applied in a zonal strip constructed in
a latitude longitude coordinate system rotated to align with the great
circle arc tangent to the gradient vector.&nbsp; The two-dimensional procedure
need not be done at every grid point, but at the locations of selected
features in the analysis field (<i>e.g.,&nbsp; </i>extrema, points along
trough and ridge axes).
<p>Finally, one may wonder if smoothing might need to be a part of T, since
the forecast and analysis grids may have different resolutions. The effect
of higher resolution on the trigonometric approximation is higher variance
associated with the higher wave number spectral components. But the lowest
wave numbers usually account for most of the variance and float to the
top of the sorting operation. As long as the same few wave number components
appear in the same order in both the forecast and the analysis list of
wave numbers arranged in order of decreasing magnitude of their variance
contributions, then the phase error computation may proceed for each such
component without regard to resolution. Ignoring the high wave number components
effectively achieves low-pass smoothing of the data.
<h1>
3. A Phase Error Application.</h1>
The method described above is used in the United States National Weather
Service's Nation Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) Hydrometeorological
Prediction Center (HPC) to provide constructive guidance to forecasters
of mean sea level pressure at projection times of three to seven days.
For the HPC verification, the zonal bands chosen for the phase error calculation
are 12 degrees of latitude wide and 28 degrees of longitude in length.
This makes them approximately one mid-latitude synoptic scale wavelength
long (~2100 to 2600 km). Nine overlapping bands cover the continental United
States. Results from each band are always treated individually; they are
never combined. The phase error is computed for only the fundamental (longest
wavelength) spectral component. Phase error presentations are created for
both the forecasters and the corresponding model guidance.
<p>Three figures are presented as examples of results of the phase error
calculation.&nbsp; Each figure shows the analysis of the mean sea level
pressure as solid blue contour lines and the forecast as dashed yellow
lines.&nbsp; The caption at the bottom of each figure gives the verifying
year, month, day, and hour along with the forecast hour, the name of the
model, the phase error, and the percentage of variance associated with
the fundamental wave for which the phase error was determined for both
the forecast and the analysis.&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="Brill_negative_error.gif">Fig.
1</a> is a 72-h forecast from the NCEP global model showing that a trough
exiting the eastern US is predicted to lag behind the observed position;
hence, the phase is error is -166 KM, a negative value.&nbsp; This band
is the Central Eastern US zonal band averaging about 2400 KM in length.&nbsp;
The amplitude of the fundamental wave of that wave length accounts for
93.7% of the forecast field variance and 84.6% of the analysis variance
on that bounded zonal band, after meridional averaging.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
<a href="Brill_positive_error.gif">Fig.
2</a> is a 96-h forecast from the European Center global model showing
a high pressure cell that the model is too quick to move off the northeastern
US coast.&nbsp; In this case, the forecast is too fast; so, the phase error
is +395 KM.&nbsp; This zonal band is the North Eastern US band having a
length of almost 2200 KM.&nbsp; The variance information is shown on the
figure caption.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <a href="Brill_null_error.gif">Fig. 3</a>&nbsp;
shows a verification on the North Western US band for which no phase error
can be computed.&nbsp; The spectral decomposition for the analysis field
differs too greatly from that for the forecast field.
<p>In the NCEP/HPC application of this method, the following information
is saved along with the phase error result:
<ol>
<li>
the amplitude error for the spectral component to which the phase error
applies</li>

<li>
the forecast variance associated with the spectral component</li>

<li>
the analysis variance associated with the spectral component</li>

<li>
the analysis phase angle</li>

<li>
the analysis amplitude</li>

<li>
the total forecast variance</li>

<li>
the total analysis variance</li>
</ol>
Saving this information allows the phase error values to be screened by
display software.&nbsp; Phase errors associated with small amplitudes may
be rejected.&nbsp; The phase error values may be weighted by the forecast
or analysis variance or the fraction of the total variance associated with
the spectral component.&nbsp; In its current configuration, the HPC display
software does not make use of these data screening possibilities.
<p>Various types of displays are generated in the HPC for assisting forecasters.&nbsp;
Time series of phase errors are presented for both forecasters and models.&nbsp;
Average positive and negative phase errors are displayed separately along
with data counts to show which sign of phase error predominated.&nbsp;
The average net phase error is also presented.&nbsp; The averaging period
is arbitrarily set at 84 days.&nbsp; These averages are presented for each
zonal band for both models and forecasters.
<p>There are several things HPC forecasters must keep in mind when looking
at individual phase errors. There are times when the phase error cannot
be computed because the forecast and analysis have different spectra. Therefore,
there will be gaps in time series plots. The values computed are "raw"
phase errors not corrected for the degree to which the spectral component
with which it is associated contributes to the total variance. The phase
errors may be more like those computed using the traditional manual method
during the cold season when the synoptic wave pattern is better defined.
