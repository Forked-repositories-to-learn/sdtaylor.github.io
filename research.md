# The Great Basin
What makes the Great Basin so great? Is it the sea of sagebrush? No ocean flowing steams? Area 51? The awesome basin and range elevation gradients? I don't know for sure. But I love this place and any research that happens in it. 

# Streams and Riparian Areas
I've worked with the Forest Service surveying riparian areas for three summers. You can't work for three years on something and not have feelings for it. Riparian areas have some of the highest (and hardest to identify) plant diversity around. They are in a constant state of disturbance and succession from a high variation in streamflow between years and seasons. 

# Big Data
I used to work for a high end computer storage company before I got a degree in "being outside". I regularly dealt with terabytes of data then. So analyzing a hundred thousand data points now doesn't make me flinch. I taught myself R and use it quit a bit now, but still go back to Python for some things. I prefer working in linux. Mainly because I can easily offload work to a remote VPS and leave my personal computer for more important things like Netflix. 

# Botany
I feel like knowing your plants in extremely useful. Knowing exactly what plant your looking at means you know a little about the history of that spot. Such as the precipitation, temperature range, whether it's a late succession are or one that's been recently disturbed.
