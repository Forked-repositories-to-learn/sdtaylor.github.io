# Phenology Forecasting
Phenology is a great for ecological forecasting. It's ubiquitous in almost all ecology studies, from global carbon budgets to local scale community dynamics. Phenology has a long history in theory, modelling, and data collection. I have several projects centered around phenology.

## [phenology.naturecast.org](http://phenology.naturecast.org "Phenology Forecasts")
This is a website which has regularly updated forecasts for flowering and leaf out of many species throughout the U.S.A.

## [pyPhenology](http://pyphenology.readthedocs.io "pyPhenology")
I wrote this software package which impliments phenology models in python to help in my research. It's also general enough that anyone can use it.
